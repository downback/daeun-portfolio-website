      <p className="text-sm text-justify">
        My artistic practice explores how forms are constructed, defined, and
        misrecognized. I explore how we come to agree on shared meanings, what
        is left outside those agreements, and what happens to what cannot be
        categorized. I am drawn to the moments when boundaries begin to blur,
        between identity and its misinterpretation, clarity and confusion,
        belonging and exclusion. These questions have taken shape in various
        works. In one video installation, I examined identity through a figure
        defined only as a “circle,” questioning what it means to assign a fixed
        form or name to something so abstract. Another work compared the
        structures of the mother tongue and foreign languages, revealing how
        something that feels natural in one linguistic system can seem alien in
        another. My thesis project expanded these ideas into a broader critique
        of categorization itself, using the concept of the “spectrum” to propose
        that boundaries should remain fluid. Across these projects, I have been
        consistently interested in how definitions emerge, how they fail, and
        what possibilities arise in spaces of ambiguity. I approach every
        project as both a host and a researcher. As a host, I create spaces for
        shared curiosity, and as a researcher, I use artistic methods to examine
        questions that logic alone cannot resolve. Most projects start with
        doubt and move into research and observation, followed by finding the
        form that best embodies the idea—whether installation, performance,
        video, or digital interface. Some of my works begin from private and
        intimate stories because I value honesty and precision more than polish
        when creating art, believing that sincerity and process should remain
        visible.

      <p className="text-muted-foreground mt-4">Work Proposal</p>
      <p className="text-sm text-justify">
        The reason my wish doesn’t come true easily is that too many interests
        are entangled, everyone has a stake. What I want is only one thing: that
        a single university accepts me, that there be a single job for me. Among
        the countless windows in countless buildings, I wish only for one of
        them to be the window of my home. It could be a humble wish, but it is
        difficult to attain because of everyone’s stakes in it. To win that one
        thing, I must overcome the countless knots tied to the countless others
        who want it.
        <br />
        <br />
        “competition rate of my interest = countless * countless”
        <br />
        <br />
        I want to cast this as a game—a game where, to get a single thing, you
        have to solve dozens of problems tangled up with it.
        <br />
        <br />
        For example, a “game that you have to make oatmeal with apples” could
        play out like this. <br />I grabbed the last apple at a shop at the same
        time as a man. I pleaded, explaining I’d been trying for three days to
        get an apple, but he said his daughter had been asking for one for a
        week as well and suggested I could have it if I convinced her she didn’t
        want it. The daughter admitted she just wanted an apple to fit in with
        friends who brought them every day. Those friends, in turn, confessed
        their parents made them bring apples for health. After I gathered them
        to talk, they decided they’d bring other snacks instead and didn’t need
        apples anymore, and I obtained the apple.
